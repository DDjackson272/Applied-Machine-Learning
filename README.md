## Applied Machine Learning
1. Homework 1 built naive Bayes classifer manually and classify MNIST dataset using random forest.
2. Homework 2 built support vector machine manually.
3. Homework 3 used principle component analysis to smooth noisy data.
4. Homework 4 applied principle coordinate analysis on mean images.
5. Homework 5 used K-means to analyze and random forest to classify human activities.
6. Homework 6 removed outliers and predict housing price using linear regression.
7. Homework 7 used `cv.glmnet` to predict data.
8. Homework 8 reconstructed input image with fixed number of pixels using Expectationâ€“maximization algorithm.
9. Homework 9 denoised nosiy MNIST dataset using a Boltzmann machine model.
10. Homework 10 optimized tensorFlow reference code and plotted accurate rate with batches.
